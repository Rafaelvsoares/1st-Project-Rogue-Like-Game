# 1st-Project-Rogue-Like-Game

<h1 style="font-size: 40px">Genre: Rogue-like</h1>

It is a grid game with gameplay similar to the binding of isaac/ enter the gungeon.<br>

#### MVP or what to expect:
<ol>
  <li>At least 1 monster with basic movement and attacks</li>
  <li>player that can shoot</li>
  <li>pickup items</li>
  <li>be able to get points</li>
</ol>

#### If MVP is achieved here are a couple of different ideas that could be implemented:
<ol>
  <li>Use canvas to have a free movement including diagonal movement</li>
  <li>Add boss battle</li>
  <li>Add music/sounds</li>
  <li>Main menu</li>
  <li>Highscore submission board</li>
  <li>Different items to pickup and use</li>
</ol>

# Things to fix
The bullets don't register on the monster when he is on the last cells. √

Fix the order of the functions, so they work accordingly √

Monster projetile ticks twice √

When player is removed from screen monster's projetiles aren't removed √

You can skipp projectiles if timed right. Leave it in as a feature √

figure out how to only use one function to shoot projectiles for player

Collision for Items
<ol>
  <li>Bomb √</li>
  <li>Heart √</li>
  <li>Coin √</li>
</ol>

Bomb
<ol>
  <li>Ticks 3 seconds √</li>
  <li>Destroys Items</li>
  <li>Damage Player √</li>
  <li>9 pixel radius explosion √</li>
</ol>

Infinite Enemy spawn 

<li>Maybe make a function to check a certain condition is met for when the monster is dead/alive infinitely. √</li>
